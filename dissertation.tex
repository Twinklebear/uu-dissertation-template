%%% -*-LaTeX-*-
%%% ====================================================================
%%% This is a sample top-level LaTeX-2e file for typesetting a thesis
%%% or dissertation at the University of Utah.  Most students find it
%%% convenient to start with a COPY of this file as a template, and
%%% then alter that copy to match their needs.
%%%
%%% There is an associated Unix Makefile that can be similarly
%%% customized, and then the only command ever needed to typeset the
%%% complete thesis is the single word "make".  Of course, during
%%% writing and typesetting, not all of the steps are needed, so
%%% often, one can just name a convenience target such as "make
%%% dvi-pass" or "make pdf-pass" to do just a single pass of LaTeX and
%%% BibTeX.
%%%
%%% There should be no, or very few, macro definitions in this file;
%%% any needed belong in a private style file, called mythesis.sty,
%%% and input below after all other packages.  The bulk of this file
%%% should just be command invocations, and any arguments that they
%%% need.
%%%
%%% We exploit the fact that TeX ignores spaces after command names to
%%% line up arguments for better readability.
%%%
%%% Each chapter should be a separate complete file, so that you can
%%% insert a command like \includeonly{chap_intro} before the first
%%% \include{chap_xxx} command to avoid typesetting all but the
%%% chapter that you are currently working on, to save time.
%%%
%%% Remember that occupants of job positions change jobs from time to
%%% time: YOU are responsible for ensuring correct names of all humans
%%% mentioned in this file!

%%% The choice of bibliography style is a major decision, jointly made
%%% by you, your thesis advisor and the thesis editor. Common choices are
%%% one of the four standard BibTeX styles (abbrv, alpha, plain, and unsrt),
%%% or enhanced styles like acm, amsplain, siam, and hundreds of others
%%% available in TeX Live, and other Unix and Windows TeX distributions.
%%%
%%% Do NOT handcode your reference list, because you are unlikely to
%%% achieve consistency or conformance to the University of Utah Thesis Office
%%% requirements: let BibTeX do that tedious job for you!
%%%
%%% Remember that reference-list metadata in BibTeX files remains
%%% constant across journals and publishers, and is are often reused
%%% in other documents and shared with others, whereas formatted
%%% reference-list styles change: with BibTeX, you only need to record
%%% the metadata once.
%%%
%%% If you prefer named, rather than numeric or tagged citations, you
%%% may use styles such as authordate{1,2,3,4}, chicago, harvard, or
%%% natbib.  Be aware, however, that most of those require an
%%% additional \usepackage{} command to supply \LaTeX{} with
%%% definitions of commands that the style needs, and that there are
%%% usually several flavors of LaTeX citation commands beyond the
%%% standard \cite{} command that you need to understand before you
%%% can use them properly in your prose.

% Sorted or unsorted?
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtranS}

%%% This can also specify a comma-separated list (without embedded
%%% spaces) of *.bib files found by BibTeX in its BIBINPUTS search
%%% path.  The argument \jobname means the base name of the top-level
%%% LaTeX file, avoiding an unnecessary filename dependence here.
%%%
%%% BibTeX writes only one .bbl file, no matter how many *.bib files
%%% are listed here, using the name \jobname.bbl.
%%%
%%% LaTeX reads BibTeX's formatted reference list from the file
%%% \jobname.bbl.

\bibliography{dissertation}

%%% The last part of this sample thesis is two specialized indexes,
%%% and a general topic index.  If the companion Makefile is used to
%%% create the DVI or PDF file for this work, the topic index excludes
%%% the lengthy list of free software packages.  However, the biology
%%% names of the first index are included in the topic index.

%%% Switch from thesis double spacing to single spacing for the three
%%% indexes, as a matter of style (to match the reference list), and
%%% for compactness.

\singlespace

%%% Define several index cross references (there are many more such
%%% in chap1.tex, but the examples here give a useful summary of how
%%% they are made):
