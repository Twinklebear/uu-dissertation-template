% This simple LaTeX style file allows .tex files produced by the
% tgrind(1) utility to be included in LaTeX documents by the command
% \tgrind{filename}.  The output from this command will always fill
% complete pages.

% tgrindmac.tex uses three Plain TeX macros that are not used in
% LaTeX, and uses \pageno which has another name in LaTeX.

% Here is what the user needs to display a TeX file from tgrind: We
% redefine \end to be a no-op so that the file need not be modified in
% any way.
